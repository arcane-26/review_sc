# product_rewiew_scrapping
I have recently completed a web scraping project that involved extracting customer reviews from the popular online shopping platform, Flipkart. Using Python, I developed a web scraper that collects reviews for specific products searched by the user. The scraper was integrated with a RESTful API and a MongoDB database, providing a secure and efficient way to store and retrieve the extracted data. This project not only allowed me to enhance my programming skills, but also provided valuable insights into data management and web scraping techniques. Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of the project and confident in its potential for practical applications.
